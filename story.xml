		<room name='the TARDIS'>You and Clara are in the TARDIS, it seems quiet after what happened recently. The doctor (you) intigued, thinks...

"Clara's state of mind seems to have changed. Perhaps she's still getting used to the *new* doctor.
After all, he didn't have these large attack eyebrows and he never left her. Maybe I have to change..."

Meanwhile, the TARDIS starts to spin out of the time vortex, everything's shaking, Clara holds on tightly and 
shouts "What are you doing Doctor?!". Most of the light vanishes except that of the TARDIS' orange glowing console. 
You go to grab your just-visible sonic screwdriver but you've lost it. You and the sonic screwdriver are slowly moving 
in zero gravity towards the top of the TARDIS console. You need the sonic screwdriver to gain control of the TARDIS. 

The console controls aren't working.<item name='sonic_screwdriver' name_type='' use='true' give='false' drop='false' take='true' weight='20G'>A very useful tool in tricky situations</item>
